In today's tech-savvy world, we're replacing the old-school pen-and-paper exams with an Online Examination System. Using PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, we're creating a user-friendly platform for conducting tests on the internet. This system makes exams more convenient, allowing students to take them from their own devices. We'll explore the basics of building this system, which can benefit schools, businesses, and organizations. You'll learn how to make it happen and be part of the digital revolution in education. This project simplifies exams, making them more accessible and efficient for everyone involved.
